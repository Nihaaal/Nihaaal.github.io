<!--ABOUT-US-->
<section class="container">
    <h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>
    <p>Education plays an important role in enabling a person to face a real life situation with adequate knowledge. A School is a temple of learning and at Nadi Sangam SKM College we are making our best effort to give quality education to our students. At Nadi Sangam SKM College we prepare students to be successful in their 21st century careers.Students must know how to think, how to solve problems, to innovate and to collaborate effectively. There is no longer a single pathway to that end, but whatever paths our students choose must be steeped with effort, dedication, relevance and relationships.</p> 

<p>In all their subjects, students are challenged beyond their comfort zones and encouraged to think critically and creatively. Students are provided with authentic learning experiences and they must be connected to adults who truly care. As the adults in their lives, we must provide guidance in the development of character. We must help students to act with compassion, accept responsibility and choose to do the right thing. Our philosophy of education has always been meeting the needs of the individual child. Children acquire skills and knowledge easily if we make the environment stimulating and purposeful. </p>

<p>In the 21st century, the Digital Revolution affects us and the learning and teaching. Quite simply, it is changing everything. In such an environment when work and effort is valued, the child's self-esteem is enhanced and from this results self-motivation. We try to understand and work with each child and we firmly believe that it is our responsibility to enable the child in our care to develop as a whole. Our commitment at SSKMC is to provide a safe and intellectually challenging environment that will empower students to become innovative thinkers, creative problem solvers and inspired learners prepared to thrive in the 21st century.</p>

<p>High standards and expectations for each student's academic performance, co-curricular participation and responsible citizenship are the foundation of our school. It is with pride that we hold these high standards and ask each of our students to commit to maintain the extraordinary record of achievement and contribution that has been the legacy of SSKMC students. It is the contribution of our students to our school community that makes SSKMC an exceptional learning community. Full participation in academic and co-curricular programs and a willingness to act responsibly as an individual within our educational environment are the factors that enable all to have a successful and enjoyable stay at Sangam College.</p>

<p>The journey that is laced beautifully with triumphs would not have been without the support from parents and stakeholders. We thank all parents, in all humility for your generosity in time, talents and resources. Thank you for constantly supporting us in every step we take and reposing your confidence in us. We deeply cherish the revered bond we have formed with you over the years. Thank you for entrusting us with the future of your children, for entrusting us to mould and sculpt their minds, enrich their souls and ignite the spark of lifelong learning in them.
